BrightMoon is a static blog template that has been secondarily modified and customized based on the [Mizuki](https://github.com/matsuzaka-yuki/mizuki) open-source theme project. It continues and enhances the modern, clean, and elegant design style along with a unique anime aesthetic. The project is built on [Astro](https://astro.build/), combining advanced functionality with exquisite visual presentation.

***Like the bright moon rising, its clear radiance remains as ever.*** </br>
***Taking this as a starting point, set forth anew.***

## 🔄 Update Frequency

Asynchronous synchronization with the mainline content of the Mizuki theme framework occurs irregularly. Future plans include custom modifications based on the framework's functionality. Version numbers will uniformly use the BrightMoon Custom Edition (CE) suffix, representing a lightly customized version for BrightMoon (Currently busy catching up on learning popular website frameworks, need to find time, wuwuwu~~~).

| Commands                   | Operations                                             |
| :------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm install`             | Install dependencies                                   |
| `pnpm dev`                 | Start the local development server at `localhost:4321` |
| `pnpm build`               | Build the production site to `./dist/`                 |
| `pnpm preview`             | Preview the build locally before deployment            |
| `pnpm check`               | Run Astro bug checks                                   |
| `pnpm format`              | Format code using Biome                                |
| `pnpm lint`                | Check and fix code issues                              |
| `pnpm new-post <filename>` | Create a new blog post                                 |
| `pnpm astro ...`           | Run Astro CLI commands                                 |

To provide developers with a smoother, more familiar experience, we still choose Biome for code formatting and fixing.

Although Mizuki version 7.6 and later switched to Prettier + ESLint, we believe Biome's "out-of-the-box" nature aligns better with our workflow, avoiding additional configuration costs.
